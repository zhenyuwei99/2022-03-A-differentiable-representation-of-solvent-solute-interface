abstract = {{To understand how a protein performs its individual biological function, it is essential to know its three-dimensional structure. As early as 1934, J.D. Bernal and Dorothy Hodgkin (then Dorothy Crowfoot) showed [Bernal, J. D. \& Crowfoot, D. Nature133, 794–795 (1934)] that proteins, when crystallized, would diffract X-rays to produce a complex pattern of spots. They knew that these patterns contained all the information needed to determine a protein–s structure but, frustratingly, that information could not be deciphered. By comparing patterns from crystals containing different heavy-metal atoms, Max Perutz and colleagues devised the approach that was to solve this riddle. In 1958, J. C. Kendrew et al. applied Perutz–s technique to produce the first three-dimensional images of any protein - myoglobin, the protein used by muscles to store oxygen.}},

(iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.}},

From the recombinant M13 clone we have obtained high levels of the enzyme (∼50\% of soluble protein) expressed in the Escherichia coli host and have converted cysteine (Cys35) at the enzyme's active site to serine.

abstract = {{Folding funnels have been the focus of considerable attention during the last few years. These have mostly been discussed in the general context of the theory of protein folding. Here we extend the utility of the concept of folding funnels, relating them to biological mechanisms and function. In particular, here we describe the shape of the funnels in light of protein synthesis and folding; flexibility, conformational diversity, and binding mechanisms; and the associated binding funnels, illustrating the multiple routes and the range of complexed conformers. Specifically, the walls of the folding funnels, their crevices, and bumps are related to the complexity of protein folding, and hence to sequential vs. nonsequential folding. Whereas the former is more frequently observed in eukaryotic proteins, where the rate of protein synthesis is slower, the latter is more frequent in prokaryotes, with faster translation rates. The bottoms of the funnels reflect the extent of the flexibility of the proteins. Rugged floors imply a range of conformational isomers, which may be close on the energy landscape. Rather than undergoing an induced fit binding mechanism, the conformational ensembles around the rugged bottoms argue that the conformers, which are most complementary to the ligand, will bind to it with the equilibrium shifting in their favor. Furthermore, depending on the extent of the ruggedness, or of the smoothness with only a few minima, we may infer nonspecific, broad range vs. specific binding. In particular, folding and binding are similar processes, with similar underlying principles. Hence, the shape of the folding funnel of the monomer enables making reasonable guesses regarding the shape of the corresponding binding funnel. Proteins having a broad range of binding, such as proteolytic enzymes or relatively nonspecific endonucleases, may be expected to have not only rugged floors in their folding funnels, but their binding funnels will also behave similarly, with a range of complexed conformations. Hence, knowledge of the shape of the folding funnels is biologically very useful. The converse also holds: If kinetic and thermodynamic data are available, hints regarding the role of the protein and its binding selectivity may be obtained. Thus, the utility of the concept of the funnel carries over to the origin of the protein and to its function.}},

abstract = {{How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the “new view” model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon–foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the “how” and the “why” questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon–foldon interactions that construct the native structure.}},

Although the range of applicability of the RF method for biomolecular systems remains to be demonstrated, for the benchmark systems the use of the RF produces molecular dipole moments, Kirkwood G factors, other structural properties, and mean-square fluctuations in excellent agreement with those obtained with the commonly used Particle Mesh Ewald method. With RF, three million- and five million-atom biological systems scale well up to ∼30k cores, producing ∼30 ns/day.

However, here we show that macrolides arrest translation of the truncated ErmDL regulatory peptide when the nascent chain is only three amino acids and therefore is too short to be juxtaposed with the antibiotic. Biochemical probing and molecular dynamics simulations of erythromycin-bound ribosomes showed that the antibiotic in the tunnel allosterically alters the properties of the catalytic center, thereby predisposing the ribosome for halting translation of specific sequences.

The machine's specialized hardware dramatically increases the speed of MD calculations, making possible for the first time the simulation of biological molecules at an atomic level of detail for periods on the order of a millisecond---about two orders of magnitude beyond the previous state of the art. Anton is now running simulations on a timescale at which many critically important, but poorly understood phenomena are known to occur, allowing the observation of aspects of protein dynamics that were previously inaccessible to both computational and experimental study. Here, we report Anton's performance when executing actual MD simulations whose accuracy has been validated against both existing MD software and experimental observations. We also discuss the manner in which novel algorithms have been coordinated with Anton's co-designed, application-specific hardware to achieve these results.}},

Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein’s constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway.

Together with spectroscopy data, evidence for self-similar, fractal time behaviour spans 13 decades—the entire range over which proteins function biologically. Internal motions of proteins are essential to their function. The time dependence of protein structural fluctuations is highly complex, manifesting subdiffusive, non-exponential behaviour with effective relaxation times existing over many decades in time, from ps up to ∼102 s (refs 1,2,3,4). Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, on timescales from 10−12 to 10−5 s, motions in single proteins are self-similar, non-equilibrium and exhibit ageing. The characteristic relaxation time for a distance fluctuation, such as inter-domain motion, is observation-time-dependent, increasing in a simple, power-law fashion, arising from the fractal nature of the topology and geometry of the energy landscape explored. Diffusion over the energy landscape follows a non-ergodic continuous time random walk. Comparison with single-molecule experiments suggests that the non-equilibrium self-similar dynamical behaviour persists up to timescales approaching the in vivo lifespan of individual protein molecules.}},

Computer simulation approaches that are targeted at questions in these systems require models which cover these scales and the respective levels of resolution. Multiscale simulation methods combine and systematically link several simulation hierarchies so that they can address phenomena at multiple levels of resolution. In order to reach the mesoscopic time- and length-scales important for many material properties, methods that bridge from the atomistic (microscopic) to a coarser (mesocopic) level are developed. Here, we review coarse-grained simulation models that are linked to a higher resolution atomistic description. In particular, we focus on structure-based coarse-graining methods which are used for a variety of soft matter problems – ranging from structure-formation in amorphous polymers to biomolecular aggregation. It is shown that by coarse-grained simulation in combination with an efficient backmapping methodology one can obtain well-equilibrated long time- and large length-scale atomistic structures of polymeric melts or biomolecular aggregates which can be used for comparison to experimental data. Methodological aspects are addressed such as the question of the time-scales and dynamics in the different simulation hierarchies and an outlook to future challenges in the area of resolution exchange approaches and adaptive resolution models is presented.}},

abstract = {{The activity within a living cell is based on a complex network of interactions among biomolecules, exchanging information and energy through biochemical processes. These events occur on different scales, from the nano- to the macroscale, spanning about 10 orders of magnitude in the space domain and 15 orders of magnitude in the time domain. Consequently, many different modeling techniques, each proper for a particular time or space scale, are commonly used. In addition, a single process often spans more than a single time or space scale. Thus, the necessity arises for combining the modeling techniques in multiscale approaches. In this Account, I first review the different modeling methods for bio-systems, from quantum mechanics to the coarse-grained and continuum-like descriptions, passing through the atomistic force field simulations. Special attention is devoted to their combination in different possible multiscale approaches and to the questions and problems related to their coherent matching in the space and time domains. These aspects are often considered secondary, but in fact, they have primary relevance when the aim is the coherent and complete description of bioprocesses. Subsequently, applications are illustrated by means of two paradigmatic examples: (i) the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family and (ii) the proteins involved in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication cycle. The GFPs are currently one of the most frequently used markers for monitoring protein trafficking within living cells; nanobiotechnology and cell biology strongly rely on their use in fluorescence microscopy techniques. A detailed knowledge of the actions of the virus-specific enzymes of HIV (specifically HIV protease and integrase) is necessary to study novel therapeutic strategies against this disease. Thus, the insight accumulated over years of intense study is an excellent framework for this Account. The foremost relevance of these two biomolecular systems was recently confirmed by the assignment of two of the Nobel prizes in 2008: in chemistry for the discovery of GFP and in medicine for the discovery of HIV. Accordingly, these proteins were studied with essentially all of the available modeling techniques, making them ideal examples for studying the details of multiscale approaches in protein modeling.}},

This allows calculating quantities that would be prohibitive within a QM/MM approach, such as thermodynamic averages involving slow motions of a protein. The method is tested on three different systems in aqueous solution:  dihydrogenphosphate, glycyl-alanine dipeptide, and a nitrosyl-dicarbonyl complex of technetium(I).

We have used multiple molecular dynamics simulations of 2–5ns duration to explore the structural dynamics of GluR2 S1S2 in the presence and absence of glutamate and in a complex with kainate. Our studies indicate that not only is the degree of domain closure dependent upon interactions with the ligand, but also that protein/ligand interactions influence the motion of the S2 domain with respect to S1. Differences in domain mobility between the three states (apo-S1S2, glutamate-bound, and kainate-bound) are surprisingly clear-cut. We discuss how these changes in dynamics may provide an explanation relating the mechanism of transmission of the agonist-binding event to channel opening. We also show here how the glutamate may adopt an alternative mode of binding not seen in the x-ray structure, which involves a key threonine (T480) side chain flipping into a new conformation. This new conformation results in an altered pattern of hydrogen bonding at the agonist-binding site.}},

An LLT has been rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal–multibaric ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an estimate of the LLCP’s location. These combined results—obtained from a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters—are strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.}},

As the "right answer," we perform isothermal-isobaric Monte Carlo simulations on the 3D MB model for different pressures and temperatures. The purpose of this work is to develop and test Wertheim's Ornstein-Zernike integral equation and thermodynamic perturbation theories. The two analytical approaches are orders of magnitude more efficient than the Monte Carlo simulations. The ultimate goal is to find statistical mechanical theories that can efficiently predict the properties of orientationally complex molecules, such as water. Also, here, the 3D MB model simply serves as a useful workbench for testing such analytical approaches. For hot water, the analytical theories give accurate agreement with the computer simulations. For cold water, the agreement is not as good. Nevertheless, these approaches are qualitatively consistent with energies, volumes, heat capacities, compressibilities, and thermal expansion coefficients versus temperature and pressure. Such analytical approaches offer a promising route to a better understanding of water and also the aqueous solvation.}},

In this paper the authors develop a systematic procedure based on two-dimensional potentials of mean force for defining cutoffs for a given pair of distance and angular coordinates. They also develop an electronic structure-based definition of hydrogen bonding in liquid water, related to the electronic occupancy of the antibonding OH orbitals. This definition turns out to be reasonably compatible with one of the distance-angle geometric definitions. These two definitions lead to an estimate of the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in liquid simple point charge∕extended (SPC∕E) water of between 3.2 and 3.4. They also used these and other hydrogen-bond definitions to examine the dynamics of local hydrogen-bond number fluctuations, finding an approximate long-time decay constant for SPC∕E water of between 0.8 and 0.9 ps , which corresponds to the time scale for local structural relaxation.}},

Water models serve as the basis of force fields used in molecular dynamics simulations of these systems. This article reports on an examination of the utility of a set of coarse-grained (CG) water models, with different resolutions, interaction potentials (Lennard–Jones, Morse), and cut-off distances. The relationships between the parameters under specific choices of the above options and the thermodynamic properties, such as density, surface tension, and compressibility, were found to fit simple mathematical equations. The limits of applicability of these CG water models were explored by checking the melting temperature. If a CG site is mapped to one or two real water molecules, a simple model with appropriate combinations of cut-off distances, functional forms, and parameters can be found to simultaneously match the experimental values of density, surface tension, and compressibility under ambient conditions. If more water molecules are included in a CG site, either the melting temperature approaches or surpasses room temperature, or the surface tension and compressibility cannot both be matched simultaneously. In striving for computational efficiency, it is still possible to find a simple CG water model with three water molecules contained in a CG bead that generates a liquid state of water with realistic values of density, surface tension and compressibility at ambient condition, but coarser models are not recommended.}},

One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.}},

Most approaches reported in the literature model one or several molecules into a single uncharged CG bead. For water, this implicit treatment of the electrostatic interactions, however, fails to mimic important properties, e.g., the dielectric screening. Therefore, a coarse-grained model for water is proposed which treats the electrostatic interactions between clusters of water molecules explicitly. Five water molecules are embedded in a spherical CG bead consisting of two oppositely charged particles which represent a dipole. The bond connecting the two particles in a bead is unconstrained, which makes the model polarizable. Experimental and all-atom simulated data of liquid water at room temperature are used for parametrization of the model. The experimental density and the relative static dielectric permittivity were chosen as primary target properties. The model properties are compared with those obtained from experiment, from clusters of simple-point-charge water molecules of appropriate size in the liquid phase, and for other CG water models if available. The comparison shows that not all atomistic properties can be reproduced by a CG model, so properties of key importance have to be selected when coarse graining is applied. Yet, the CG model reproduces the key characteristics of liquid water while being computationally 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than standard fine-grained atomistic water models.}},

A fundamental property of these channels is the ability to open or close in response to changes in the membrane potential. To date, their structure-based activation mechanism remains unclear, and there is a large controversy on how these gates function at the molecular level, in particular, how movements of the voltage sensor domain are coupled to channel gating. So far, all mechanisms proposed for this coupling are based on the crystal structure of the open voltage-gated Kv1.2 channel and structural models of the closed form based on electrophysiology experiments. Here, we use coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations that allow conformational changes from the open to the closed form of the channel (embedded in its membrane environment) to be followed. Despite the low specificity of the CG force field, the obtained closed structure satisfies several experimental constraints. The overall results suggest a gating mechanism in which a lateral displacement the S4-S5 linker leads to a closing of the gate. Only a small up-down movement of the S4 helices is noticed. Additionally, the study suggests a peculiar upward motion of the intracellular tetramerization domain of the channel, hence providing a molecular view on how this domain may further regulate conduction in Kv channels.}},

Brooks III, J Chem Phys 2002, 116, 10606) we have recast the calculation of the self-electrostatic solvation energy to utilize a simple smoothing function at the dielectric boundary. The present GB model is formulated in this manner to provide consistency with the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory previously developed to yield numerically stable electrostatic solvation forces based on finite-difference methods (W. Im, D. Beglov, and B. Roux, Comp Phys Commun 1998, 111, 59). Our comparisons show that the present GB model is indeed an efficient and accurate approach to reproduce corresponding PB solvation energies and forces. With only two adjustable parameters—a0 to modulate the Coulomb field term, and a1 to include a correction term beyond Coulomb field—the PB solvation energies are reproduced within 1\% error on average for a variety of proteins. Detailed analysis shows that the PB energy can be reproduced within 2\% absolute error with a confidence of about 95\%. In addition, the solvent-exposed surface area of a biomolecule, as commonly used in calculations of the nonpolar solvation energy, can be calculated accurately and efficiently using the simple smoothing function and the volume integration method. Our implicit solvent GB calculations are about 4.5 times slower than the corresponding vacuum calculations. Using the simple smoothing function makes the present GB model roughly three times faster than GB models, which attempt to mimic the Lee–Richards molecular volume. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study presents a parallel refactoring of the original GBSW algorithm and its implementation on newly available, low cost graphics chips with thousands of processing cores. Depending on the system size and nonbonded force cutoffs, the new GBSW algorithm offers speed increases of between one and two orders of magnitude over previous implementations while maintaining similar levels of accuracy. We find that much of the algorithm scales linearly with an increase of system size, which makes this water model cost effective for solvating large systems.

Here we give an overview of one such approximation, the generalized Born model, which is simple and fast enough to be used for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, both for its fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for its ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations.

Charge and dielectric radii models were adapted from the CHARMM and Amber force fields. Finite difference PB calculations were carried out with the Delphi and PEP programs, and for several examples the matrix of all pairwise interaction energies was determined. In general, this parameterization of the GB model does an excellent job of reproducing the PB solvation energies for small molecules and for groups near the surface of larger molecules. There is a systematic tendency for this GB model to overestimate the effects of solvent screening (compared to PB) for pairs of buried atoms, but individual errors tend to cancel, and a good overall account of conformational energetics is obtained. A simple extension to the GB model to account for salt effects (in the linearized Debye–Hückel approximation) is proposed that does a good job of reproducing the salt dependence of the PB calculations. In many cases, it should be possible to replace PB calculations with much simpler GB models, but care needs to be taken for systems with extensive burial of charges or dipoles.}},

Here, absolute binding free energies are reported for the complex H-Ras/C-Raf1 using the MM-PB(GB)SA approach, testing the internal consistency and model dependence of the results. Averaging gas-phase energies (MM), solvation free energies as determined by Generalized Born models (GB/SA), and entropic contributions calculated by normal mode analysis for snapshots obtained from 10 ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics in general results in an overestimation of the binding affinity when a solvent-accessible surface area-dependent model is used to estimate the nonpolar solvation contribution. Applying the sum of a cavity solvation free energy and explicitly modeled solute–solvent van der Waals interaction energies instead provides less negative estimates for the nonpolar solvation contribution. When the polar contribution to the solvation free energy is determined by solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PB) instead, the calculated binding affinity strongly depends on the atomic radii set chosen. For three GB models investigated, different absolute deviations from PB energies were found for the unbound proteins and the complex. As an alternative to normal-mode calculations, quasiharmonic analyses have been performed to estimate entropic contributions due to changes of solute flexibility upon binding. However, such entropy estimates do not converge after 10 ns of simulation time, indicating that sampling issues may limit the applicability of this approach. Finally, binding free energies estimated from snapshots of the unbound proteins extracted from the complex trajectory result in an underestimate of binding affinity. This points to the need to exercise caution in applying the computationally cheaper “one-trajectory-alternative” to systems where there may be significant changes in flexibility and structure due to binding. The best estimate for the binding free energy of Ras–Raf obtained in this study of −8.3 kcal mol−1 is in good agreement with the experimental result of −9.6 kcal mol−1, however, further probing the transferability of the applied protocol that led to this result is necessary. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {{Accurate yet efficient computational models of solvent environment are central for most calculations that rely on atomistic modeling, such as prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed generalized Born implicit solvent model, GBNSR6 (Aguilar et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 3613-3639), in estimating the electrostatic solvation free energies (ΔG(pol)) and binding free energies (ΔΔG(pol)) for small protein-ligand complexes. We also compare estimates based on three different explicit solvent models (TIP3P, TIP4PEw, and OPC). The two main findings are as follows. First, the deviation (RMSD = 7.04 kcal/mol) of GBNSR6 binding affinities from commonly used TIP3P reference values is comparable to the deviations between explicit models themselves, e.g. TIP4PEw vs TIP3P (RMSD = 5.30 kcal/mol). A simple uniform adjustment of the atomic radii by a single scaling factor reduces the RMS deviation of GBNSR6 from TIP3P to within the above "error margin" - differences between ΔΔG(pol) estimated by different common explicit solvent models. The simple radii scaling virtually eliminates the systematic deviation (ΔΔG(pol)) between GBNSR6 and two out of the three explicit water models and significantly reduces the deviation from the third explicit model. Second, the differences between electrostatic binding energy estimates from different explicit models is disturbingly large; for example, the deviation between TIP4PEw and TIP3P estimates of ΔΔG(pol) values can be up to ∼50\% or ∼9 kcal/mol, which is significantly larger than the "chemical accuracy" goal of ∼1 kcal/mol. The absolute ΔG(pol) calculated with different explicit models could differ by tens of kcal/mol. These discrepancies point to unacceptably high sensitivity of binding affinity estimates to the choice of common explicit water models. The absence of a clear "gold standard" among these models strengthens the case for the use of accurate implicit solvation models for binding energetics, which may be orders of magnitude faster.}},

One approach to extend the simulation time scale is to perform long simulations on specialized and expensive supercomputers such as Anton. Ideally, however, folding simulations would be more economical while retaining reasonable accuracy, and provide feedback on structure, stability and function rapidly enough if partnered directly with experiment. Approaches to this problem typically involve varied compromises between accuracy, precision, and cost; the goal here is to address whether simple implicit solvent models have become sufficiently accurate for their weaknesses to be offset by their ability to rapidly provide much more precise conformational data as compared to explicit solvent. We demonstrate that our recently developed physics-based model performs well on this challenge, enabling accurate all-atom simulated folding for 16 of 17 proteins with a variety of sizes, secondary structure, and topologies. The simulations were carried out using the Amber software on inexpensive GPUs, providing ∼1 μs/day per GPU, and >2.5 ms data presented here. We also show that native conformations are preferred over misfolded structures for 14 of the 17 proteins. For the other 3, misfolded structures are thermodynamically preferred, suggesting opportunities for further improvement.}},

The OPLSAA force field is used for the β-hairpin in both implicit and explicit solvent simulations, and the conformational space sampling is carried out with a highly parallel replica-exchange method. Surprisingly, we find from exhaustive conformation space sampling that the free energy landscape from the implicit solvent model is quite different from that of the explicit solvent model. In the implicit solvent model some nonnative states are heavily overweighted, and more importantly, the lowest free energy state is no longer the native β-strand structure. An overly strong salt-bridge effect between charged residues (E42, D46, D47, E56, and K50) is found to be responsible for this behavior in the implicit solvent model. Despite this, we find that the OPLSAA/SGB energies of all the nonnative structures are higher than that of the native structure; thus the OPLSAA/SGB energy is still a good scoring function for structure prediction for this β-hairpin. Furthermore, the β-hairpin population at 282 K is found to be less than 40\% from the implicit solvent model, which is much smaller than the 72\% from the explicit solvent model and ≈80\% from experiment. On the other hand, both implicit and explicit solvent simulations with the OPLSAA force field exhibit no meaningful helical content during the folding process, which is in contrast to some very recent studies using other force fields.}},

abstract = {{The Generalized Born (GB) continuum solvent model is arguably the most widely used implicit solvent model in protein folding and protein structure prediction simulations; however, it still remains an open question on how well the model behaves in these large-scale simulations. The current study uses the β-hairpin from C-terminus of protein G as an example to explore the folding free energy landscape with various GB models, and the results are compared to the explicit solvent simulations and experiments. All free energy landscapes are obtained from extensive conformation space sampling with a highly parallel replica exchange method. Because solvation model parameters are strongly coupled with force fields, five different force field/solvation model combinations are examined and compared in this study, namely the explicit solvent model: OPLSAA/SPC model, and the implicit solvent models: OPLSAA/SGB (Surface GB), AMBER94/GBSA (GB with Solvent Accessible Surface Area), AMBER96/GBSA, and AMBER99/GBSA. Surprisingly, we find that the free energy landscapes from implicit solvent models are quite different from that of the explicit solvent model. Except for AMBER96/GBSA, all other implicit solvent models find the lowest free energy state not the native state. All implicit solvent models show erroneous salt-bridge effects between charged residues, particularly in OPLSAA/SGB model, where the overly strong salt-bridge effect results in an overweighting of a non-native structure with one hydrophobic residue F52 expelled from the hydrophobic core in order to make better salt bridges. On the other hand, both AMBER94/GBSA and AMBER99/GBSA models turn the β-hairpin in to an α-helix, and the α-helical content is much higher than the previously reported α-helices in an explicit solvent simulation with AMBER94 (AMBER94/TIP3P). Only AMBER96/GBSA shows a reasonable free energy landscape with the lowest free energy structure the native one despite an erroneous salt-bridge between D47 and K50. Detailed results on free energy contour maps, lowest free energy structures, distribution of native contacts, α-helical content during the folding process, NOE comparison with NMR, and temperature dependences are reported and discussed for all five models.

WW domains have been proposed as one such model system. Whereas the folding of the WW domains from human Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Pin have been shown to obey single-exponential kinetics, the folding of the WW domain from formin-binding protein (FBP) 28 has been shown to proceed via biphasic kinetics. From an analysis of free-energy landscapes from atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, the biphasic folding kinetics observed in the FBP WW domain may be traced to the ability of this WW domain to adopt two slightly different forms of packing in its hydrophobic core. This conformational change is propagated along the peptide backbone and affects the position of a tryptophan residue shown in other WW domains to play a key role in binding. The WW domains of Pin and YAP do not support more than one type of packing each, leading to monophasic folding kinetics. The ability of the FBP WW domain to assume two different types of packing may, in turn, explain the capacity of this WW domain to bind two classes of ligand, a property that is not shared by other WW domains. These findings lead to the hypothesis that lability with respect to conformations separated by an observable barrier as a requirement for function is incompatible with the ability of a protein to fold via single-exponential kinetics.}},

Here, we review a particular class of so-called fast implicit solvent models, generalized Born (GB) models, which are widely used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. These approaches model hydration effects and provide solvent-dependent forces with efficiencies comparable to molecular-mechanics calculations on the solute alone; as such, they can be incorporated into MD or other conformational searching strategies in a straightforward manner. The foundations of the GB model are reviewed, followed by examples of newer, emerging models and examples of important applications. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses, both for fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for the ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations.

NMR, calorimetric, and modeling investigations have revealed that the thermodynamics of ligand binding involve a complex interplay between competing enthalpic and entropic terms. We performed six independent, 1.2 μs molecular-dynamics simulations on MUP—three replicates on the apo-protein, and three on the complex with the pheromone isobutylmethoxypyrazine. Our findings provide the most comprehensive picture to date of the structure and dynamics of MUP, and how they are modulated by ligand binding. The mechanical pathways by which amino acid side chains can transmit information regarding ligand binding to surface loops and either increase or decrease their flexibility (entropy-entropy compensation) are identified. Dewetting of the highly hydrophobic binding cavity is confirmed, and the results reveal an aspect of ligand binding that was not observed in earlier, shorter simulations: bound ligand retains extensive rotational freedom. Both of these features have significant implications for interpretations of the entropic component of binding. More generally, these simulations test the ability of current molecular simulation methods to produce a reliable and reproducible picture of protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale.}},

The limitation is due to rough energy landscapes, with many local minima separated by high-energy barriers, which govern the biomolecular motion.Scope of reviewIn the past few decades methods have been developed that address the sampling problem, such as replica-exchange molecular dynamics, metadynamics and simulated annealing. Here we present an overview over theses sampling methods in an attempt to shed light on which should be selected depending on the type of system property studied.Major conclusionsEnhanced sampling methods have been employed for a broad range of biological systems and the choice of a suitable method is connected to biological and physical characteristics of the system, in particular system size. While metadynamics and replica-exchange molecular dynamics are the most adopted sampling methods to study biomolecular dynamics, simulated annealing is well suited to characterize very flexible systems. The use of annealing methods for a long time was restricted to simulation of small proteins; however, a variant of the method, generalized simulated annealing, can be employed at a relatively low computational cost to large macromolecular complexes.General significanceMolecular dynamics trajectories frequently do not reach all relevant conformational substates, for example those connected with biological function, a problem that can be addressed by employing enhanced sampling algorithms.
